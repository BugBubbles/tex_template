	abstract = {We present the ﬁrst deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We ﬁnd that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

	title = {An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07086},
	abstract = {We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning ({RL}). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a critic network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an actor network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-speciﬁc score such as {BLEU}. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional {RL} setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.},
